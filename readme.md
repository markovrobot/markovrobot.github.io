# Markov Robot

**MATH UN2015 Linear Algebra and Probability Project. Columbia University. Fall 2024.**

## Goal

Modern robotics relies on decision-making under uncertainty. Markov chains can serve as a powerful mathematical tool to model probabilistic state transitions.

In this project, we decided to use [Three.js][https://threejs.org] as a 3D engine.

## Realization

Implemented as Marckov Chain, this model calculates the robot's next state based on predefined probabilities. It ensures seamless handling of the states using predefined transition probabilities from the matrix.

By simulating a robot in a 3D virtual environment, this project bridges theory and application, showcasing how linear algebra and probability interact to solve real-world challenges such as object collection, collision avoidance, and energy management.
